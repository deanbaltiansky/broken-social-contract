## Summary

What are the consequences of a broken social contract? The current research posits that political discontent—the dissatisfaction with, distrust in, and desire to change political institutions—is driven by the subjective experience of a broken social contract. Specifically, we show that those who believe that the government is not living up to its founding promise are more likely to endorse anti-establishment sentiment, support radical change, and distrust national institutions. In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of Americans (N = 1,188) listed the guiding values of the U.S. on paper and the guiding values of the U.S. in practice. The linguistic distance between the two lists in semantic space was positively associated with political discontent. In Study 2, another nationally representative sample of Americans (N = 994), participants rated the government on the eight overarching values of the U.S. on paper that were derived from a computational clustering of Study 1 responses. Again, those who believed the government is not delivering on its founding promise were more likely to display political discontent. In Study 3, another nationally representative sample (N = 1,823) participated in a novel experimental paradigm designed to isolate the causal effect of a broken social contract on political discontent. Those who reflected on the ways in which the U.S. is not delivering on its promise consequently endorsed greater anti-establishment sentiment and radical change. This research highlights the social contract—an implicit agreement between a state and its citizens—as an important lens through which to understand growing political discontent in the U.S.
